*** must be having the replicate-same-server-id IO thread error ***
Slave_IO_Errno= 1593
Slave_IO_Error= Fatal error: The slave I/O thread stops because master and slave have equal MySQL server ids; these ids must be different for replication to work (or the --replicate-same-server-id option must be used on slave but this does not always make sense; please check the manual before using it).
