# BUG#31582: 5.1-telco-6.1 -> 5.1.22. Slave crashes when reading
#            UPDATE for VARCHAR

# This is a problem for any update statement replicating from an old
# server to a new server. The bug consisted of a new slave trying to
# read two column bitmaps, but there is only one available in the old
# format.

# This test case should be executed replicating from an old server to
# a new server, so make sure you have one handy.
