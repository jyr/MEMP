# Bug#7100 relay_log_space_max missing from SHOW VARIABLES

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'relay_log_space_limit';

# Matz says: I have no idea what this is supposed to test, but it has
# potential for generating different results with some storage engines
# that process rows in an order not dependent on the insertion order.
# For instance, I would assume that distributed storage engines (like
# NDB) could process rows based on locality.
