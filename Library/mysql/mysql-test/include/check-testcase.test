# This test is executed twice for each test case if mysql-test-run is passed
# the flag --check-testcase. Before every testcase it is run with mysqltest
# in record mode and will thus produce an output file that can be compared
# to output from after the tescase.
# In that way its possible to check that a testcase does not have
# any unwanted side affects.
